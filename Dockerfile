# Main container
# Github actions runs the container with some specific configuration:
# - The user is root
# - The $HOME environment variable is set to /github/home and shared as a volume from the runner folder: /home/runner/work/_temp/_github_home
# - The workdir is set to /github/workspace
# - Contrary to their documentation, the inputs are correctly passed as INTPUT_* environment variables
